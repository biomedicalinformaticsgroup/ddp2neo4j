# autism4j

1. A generic package for loading/parsing/inmorting/exporting ontology to neo4j.
2. A module which deal with annotation data, specifically autism patient data.
3. A statistic module for analysis such as enrichment analysis and semantic similarity. 
4. may contain possible wrapping of existing C++/R/Python code

* Colin has python code to export/import obo file to/from the server. NRG is running a neo4j server. (account created:xin)
* Colin: C++ code to contruct a network/vetice/edge object. 
* Colin: C++ hypergeometric test for enrichment test. Accept the two comparing gene list as input.
* R code for entrypy calculation on igraph network. Example in PPI network. Code is currently workong with undirect graph, needs to be implement to work with directional graph.
